Now that the 'restock_updater' script is done, we need to acknowledge that depending on the Google sheets query function is not functional. The core reason is that the action of this script is to update the source data values, that is the 'restock_status' soh column. However, as this is updated, the results of the query also change, causing the manually entered 'restocked' column to become out of alignment with the new query results. A better solution would be to have the query occur in python, but the query is outputted to google sheets. This would result in a static table that I can use to note the 'restocked' values, which can then be drawn upon to update the 'soh' values, and preserving a record of the restock.

To be workable, we require that:
- scripts can be run from mobile.

There a number of problems with the above arrangement which are not worth mentioning currently, and can be solved down the track.
