I am still trying to make the code work on my iPhone. I found that the reason pip wasnt working was that is hasnt been added to a PATH, and can only be run from the \bin directory. This discovery means that I was able to install the dependencies required based on the requirements.txt file, however there were a number of concerning errors that arose from this. There were also some errors with the google module dependencies which were fixed by running various google pip intall commands found on the internet. 

The current problem is that the google dependencies were not installed globally, thus Python3 needs to be run from the Docuemnts or bin folder, but then the script cant find the package files, presumably because running the Python3 command there sets the PWD to Documents, not Documents/Menzies... Problematic. I should test that first.

I need a better understanding of how python works.. and the shell.

The problem: 

1. Call python script from its dir results in it not being able to find the google modules.
2. Calling the script from the documents dir, which can access the modules, results in it not being able to find the credentials.json file stored in the package dir.

Questions:
1. How does pip work? Pip is simply a package installer.
2. How do python packages work?
3. How do path variables work?

1711 - after drawing a blank on getting the script working on a-shell, i heavily refactored the project to make code management easier. I will now be refactoring the restock_updater.py file to take advantage of the modules created therein.

1754 - refactoring is done. Now I'd like to produce some result output. The standard sheets api response on cell updates is unwieldy, and only outputs the new cell values with no reference to row values such as the wine name. A useful report would be the a df of the updated wines. Simplest way to would just be to putput the restock df after dropping wines that were not restockd.

2 reports:

1. wines that were restocked.
2. wines that were not restocked.

1845 - further then that, I've confirmed that the stock status queries are outputting as expected. Now what about a dashboard?

1856 - We'll try the methd detailed [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-easiest-way-to-create-an-interactive-dashboard-in-python-77440f2511d1) which uses hvPlot and Panel.

1937 - Too complicated. Will need to understand the following:
- [x] hvplot
- [ ] panel
- [x] pandas pipelines
- [ ] .interactive()

## pandas pipelines

In hindsight, the author is not using the term 'pipeline' in the technical sense to refer to pandas.pipe(), but rather the abstract concept of a processing pipeline.

Regardless, here it is as follows:

pandas.pipe() is a function used to chain together other functions that take Series, DataFrames or GroupBy objects in order to produce segmented operations. The intent is to be able to have reusable transformations and operations defined in seperate functions which are then applied as needed^[[pandas.DataFrame.pipe — pandas 1.5.3 documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pipe.html?highlight=pipe#pandas.DataFrame.pipe)].

## hvPlot

hvPlot is a Python package that works with a number of data processing packages to produce interactive plots. hvPlot is designed primarily for use in notebooks, but it can be rendered with a script or from the command line with the following syntax:

```python
import hvplot.pandas

plot = df.hvplot()

hvplot.show()
```

[hvplot · PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hvplot/)

## Python panel

Panel is a Python library used to create web apps and dashboards by connectin user defined widgets to plots, images, tables, or text^[[Overview — Panel v0.14.2](https://panel.holoviz.org/)].

The idea behind panels is that you define standard python data functions, then 'bind' panel behavior to them. 

Panels can be displayed using the Jupyter kernel, but can also be used in a stand-alone web server. Items to be displayed in the web server need to have the `.servable()` function called upon them, then run `panel serve --show <.py file>` in a shell. It can also be told to refresh on code changes with `panel serve --show --autoreload <.py file>`.
