I am still trying to make the code work on my iPhone. I found that the reason pip wasnt working was that is hasnt been added to a PATH, and can only be run from the \bin directory. This discovery means that I was able to install the dependencies required based on the requirements.txt file, however there were a number of concerning errors that arose from this. There were also some errors with the google module dependencies which were fixed by running various google pip intall commands found on the internet. 

The current problem is that the google dependencies were not installed globally, thus Python3 needs to be run from the Docuemnts or bin folder, but then the script cant find the package files, presumably because running the Python3 command there sets the PWD to Documents, not Documents/Menzies... Problematic. I should test that first.

I need a better understanding of how python works.. and the shell.

The problem: 

1. Call python script from its dir results in it not being able to find the google modules.
2. Calling the script from the documents dir, which can access the modules, results in it not being able to find the credentials.json file stored in the package dir.

Questions:
1. How does pip work? Pip is simply a package installer.
2. How do python packages work?
3. How do path variables work?

1711 - after drawing a blank on getting the script working on a-shell, i heavily refactored the project to make code management easier. I will now be refactoring the restock_updater.py file to take advantage of the modules created therein.
